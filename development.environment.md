# Development Environment
The following are list of items I have setup for my development environment.

## Visual Studio
What can I say since I mostly program in C# I really can't find another IDE that can beat Visual Studio debugging and testing tools.

## Visual Studio Code
This became text editor since its a light weight and has tons of extensions for most of my needs


### Extensions

| Extension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Code spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)  | I suck at spelling so this helps me out. |
| [PowerShell](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell) | Most of my scripting is with Powershell 
| [Remote WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) | Allows you to interact with any folder from windows sub system.
| [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) | Started to use this over post man. 

## Git Fork
I sucks at Git commands (I know I need to work on this) so I use Git Fork:

- Light weight and quick
- has a dark theme
- doesn't crash or get slow like other clients

## Fire Code Medium Font
It makes source code easier to read since it combine certain combinations of characters into one.
